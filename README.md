## The Next Architectural Primitive in Tokenization

Large language models remain linguistically blind to Abugida scripts. Byte-Pair Encoding and its descendants routinely shatter complex conjuncts — atomic multi-codepoint grapheme clusters that constitute the fundamental phonetic units of Indic and Southeast Asian writing systems — into meaningless sub-character fragments. The result is degraded reasoning, inflated inference costs, and a systemic “Token Tax” that disproportionately burdens more than one billion speakers.

**WWHO (Where-What-How Often) introduces the clean separation of concerns the field has been missing.**

By decoupling linguistic structural constraints from statistical compression, WWHO builds a unified meta-vocabulary space:

1. **Layer 1 (Where): Code-Switching Router**  
   A linear $O(N)$ block scanner that evaluates characters in $O(1)$ time to inherently identify script boundaries, routing Latin text to proven frontier tokenizers (like `o200k_base`) while sending Abugida text for specialized processing.
2. **Layer 2 (What): LinguisTrie**  
   Enforces linguistic integrity by construction: a DFA based syllabifier segments raw Unicode into well-formed syllables with a formal zero-breakage guarantee.  
3. **Layer 3 (How Often): SGPE & Meta-Vocabulary**  
   Performs statistical pair merging exclusively over this linguistically sound stream, safely projecting the resulting tokens into a unified, mathematically offset ID space.

Sinhala and Devanagari serve as the high-complexity proofs-of-concept. The same architecture generalizes directly to Tamil, Khmer, Myanmar, and the broader Abugida family.

## Multi-Script Stratified Benchmarks (122.2M Characters)

We evaluated WWHO against frontier models across a 1.5 million sentence code-switched corpus containing Sinhala, Hindi (Devanagari), and English. 

### 1. Sinhala Efficiency
| Tokenizer | Tokens | TWR | Chr/Tok | % Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SGPE(WWHO)** | **6,654,288** | **1.274** | **4.83** | **-** |
| OpenAI (o200k_base) | 17,360,196 | 3.324 | 1.85 | 61.7% |
| Llama 4 Scout | 18,157,707 | 3.476 | 1.77 | 63.4% |
| DeepSeek V3 | 29,152,698 | 5.581 | 1.10 | 77.2% |

### 2. Hindi (Devanagari) Efficiency
| Tokenizer | Tokens | TWR | Chr/Tok | % Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SGPE(WWHO)** | **13,433,554** | **1.181** | **4.29** | **-** |
| OpenAI (o200k_base) | 18,394,075 | 1.617 | 3.13 | 27.0% |
| Llama 4 Scout | 19,566,121 | 1.720 | 2.94 | 31.3% |
| DeepSeek V3 | 31,682,218 | 2.786 | 1.82 | 57.6% |

### 3. English
| Tokenizer | Tokens | TWR | Chr/Tok | % Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SGPE(WWHO)** | **7,240,147** | **1.330** | **4.46** | **-** |
| OpenAI (o200k_base) | 7,420,527 | 1.364 | 4.35 | 2.4% |
| Llama 4 Scout | 7,512,843 | 1.381 | 4.30 | 3.6% |
| DeepSeek V3 | 7,904,670 | 1.453 | 4.09 | 8.4% |

*(Note: Because WWHO routes Latin text directly to the native Tiktoken sequence, English performance is mathematically identical. The minor delta in total tokens emerges solely from boundary crossing mechanics.)*

### 4. Overall (Mixed-Script)
| Tokenizer | Tokens | TWR | Chr/Tok | % Reduction |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **SGPE(WWHO)** | **27,327,989** | **1.240** | **4.47** | **-** |
| OpenAI (o200k_base) | 43,174,798 | 1.959 | 2.83 | 36.7% |
| Llama 4 Scout | 45,236,671 | 2.053 | 2.70 | 39.6% |
| DeepSeek V3 | 68,739,586 | 3.119 | 1.78 | 60.2% |

- **Zero-Breakage Guarantee**: Validated through exhaustive testing permutations across all supported Abugida scripts (0 violations).  
- **Full-corpus reconstruction**: 1.5M code-switched sentences encoded and decoded with 0 non-UNK mismatches.  
- **UNK rate**: 0.08 % (restricted strictly to rare compounds without violating structural boundaries).

WWHO radically compresses the context window for Abugida text, effectively ending the Token Tax without penalizing existing state-of-the-art programming and reasoning capabilities.
